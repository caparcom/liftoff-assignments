# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This application will be able to provide a centralized way for a group (friends, coworkers, strangers) for gifts, where you could view other people’s lists, update your own, and even mark gifts on another person’s list as purchased (without that person knowing) so that nobody ends up with duplicates and nobody gets confused.
Our Group Gift List Tracker will make it easy for people to create, update, and manage their own lists of things they’d like to receive as gifts as well as interact with the lists of others in their group. It shares some similarity, for example, in function to a wedding registry, but with the additional focus on groups and not limited to a specific event. AND it’s marketplace-agnostic, which makes it much more useful since you don’t have to tie yourself to one retailer. 

### Features
-User login: Users will be able to create an account and log in to the application. Each user will have their own separate page. 
-Authentication levels: In any given group, there will be 1) admin-level users who can add people to groups and send out group-wide notices and 2) regular users who can do normal things.
-Create group: Admin-level users can create a group and invite people to join.
-Manage gift wish list: Users can create gift wish lists on their own page and later update them as needed.
-Interact with other wish lists: Users can view the wish lists of other people in the group.
-Mark items as purchased: Users can mark items on another’s wish list to let everyone else know that it has been purchased. These marks can be seen by everyone *except* the owner of that wish list so that they won’t know what people are getting for them.
-Communicate with others: Users can click a button to send an email to another user in the group to ask follow-up questions, e.g. “What size shirt do you wear?”, “You mention earrings, but would other jewelry be okay?”, “Are multiple gift cards okay”?, etc.
